A study focused on the detection and analysis of the emotions associated with the main elements that characterize board games, using comments from a popular website (BGG) as data.
The structure of the repository is organized in this way:

- Main_Code contains the code involving the development of the project and the results.
- BGG_mining contains the code used to extract data and create the dataset.
- Aspect_Mining are two files containing functions that are used inside 'Main_Code' for performing the ABSA and the aggregation.
